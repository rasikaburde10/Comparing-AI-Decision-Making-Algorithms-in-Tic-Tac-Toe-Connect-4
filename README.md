# Comparing-AI-Decision-Making-Algorithms-in-Tic-Tac-Toe-Connect-4

I have created three notebooks:
i) MinMax vs Semi-Intelligent
ii) Q-Learning vs Semi-Intelligent
iii) MinMax vs Q-Learning

---To execute all the three comparisons just open the notebook and run all---

---> You can also change the depth of minmax algorithm to try the algorithm for different depths.
---> ***For Connect 4 you can downlaod pre trained weights of q-learning 'TicTacToeQL_Model3.pickle' from the drive link below or you may uncomment the parts for creating and storing the model if you want it for yourself***

2) Connect 4

I have created three notebooks:
i) MinMax vs Semi-Intelligent
ii) Q-Learning vs Semi-Intelligent
iii) MinMax vs Q-Learning

---To execute all the three comparisons just open the notebook and run all---

***For Connect 4 you can downlaod pre trained weights of q-learning 'Connect4QLModel.pickle' from the drive link below or you may uncomment the parts for creating and storing the model if you want it for yourself***

---> you can also change the depth of minmax algorithm to try the algorithm for different depths.

######For Q-Learning, whenever you run a simulation, please restart the kernel. The weights may cause MemoryError after loading the files 2 times or more######
